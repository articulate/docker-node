<!--
  The policy.xml file is used by Imagemagick to define a security policy.

  In our case we want to only allow the processing of safe image formats, and prevent any
  use of Imagemagick's other functions like PDF or movie handling, since those are often implicated in security vulnerabilities.

  Information on previously reported Imagemagick vulnerabilities and policy.xml based mitigations can be found here:
  - https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2018/08/21/2
  - https://imagetragick.com/

  This file should be placed in /etc/Imagemagick-6 (at least on our current Debian distribution).
  We do this by way of a COPY command in the Dockerfile.

  To verify the policy:
  - use the command 'identify -list policy' to see if the policy file gets picked up
  - use 'identify' on various image types to see if Imagemagick allows/blocks what you want it to
  (Tip: use wget to pull in various files in your local container to test them out)

  Note: most Imagemagick documentation shows a security policy with an aggregate pattern, like {GIF,JPEG,PNG,WEBP}
  However, that only works from Imagemagick 6.9.7-9 upwards, and Debian 9 gives us only 6.9.7-4 at this time.
  So here we have to specify them on seperate lines.
